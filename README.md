# The Delicious Diet of Death

That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die.
The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown.
The world is indeed comic, but the joke is on mankind.

_"Yes, fear is indeed all around us"_, came an disembodied voice from nowhere particular
_"but praise me and banish the xenos. Purge the chaos in our midst and fear shall be no more"_
